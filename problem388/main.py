# How would you explain web cookies to someone non-technical?

# First, it helps to give a motivation of why it might be useful to understand web cookies and what they are. 
# Then, give a useful example by analogy of how they work. 
# Here's how we might explain web cookies.

# When you open your browser and visit www.facebook.com, your browser already knows know you're signed in and log in automatically. 
# Or, say you're on a shopping website for skis and then you start getting ads for skis. 
# How does your browser know this stuff?

# The answer is web cookies.

# Essentially, a cookie is a little piece of information that is saved on your browser by a website, and that your computer sends to websites when you visit them in the future. 
# This information could be anything, really, but usually it's a either a login cookie, so the website knows who you are and can log you in automatically, or it's a tracking cookie, which reports to sites what you've been browsing and connects your accounts across the web, and which tech companies like Facebook and Google use to track your behavior to better serve ads.

# Each cookie has a couple settings that are important. 
# First, you can set when the cookie expires, so that after a certain set time, the cookie gets deleted. 
# There's also the domain which the cookie works on. 
# As a website, you can only set a cookie's domain to your own domain.

# So how can services like Facebook and Google track you across the web? 
# The answer is that many sites include ads from these sites on their own domains which add cookies when you browse them. 
# So, if you're browsing site a.com and it loads a Google ad, then the ad itself will set a cookie on something like ad.google.com. 
# Then, when browsing site b.com, which also has a Google ad, the cookie will work on that site too. 
# That's how advertisers can track you across the web.
